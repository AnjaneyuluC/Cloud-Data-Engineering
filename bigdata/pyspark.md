# Spark Introduction

1. Single computer works perfectly well for watching movies or working with spreadsheet software
2. However, as many users likely experience at some point, there are some things that your computer is not powerful enough to perform
3. One particularly challenging area is data processing

4. As of now only solution is

5. PySpark is a Spark library written in Python to run Python applications using Apache Spark capabilities, using PySpark we can run applications parallelly on the distributed cluster (multiple nodes)

5. In the begining, Spark written in Scala and later on due to its industry adaptation itâ€™s API PySpark released for Python using Py4J.
6. Py4J is a Java library that is integrated within PySpark and allows python to dynamically interface with JVM objects, hence to run PySpark you also need Java to be installed along with Python, and Apache Spark
7. spark features
    1. In-memory computation
    2. Distributed processing using parallelize
    3. Can be used with many cluster managers (Spark, Yarn, Mesos e.t.c)
    4. Fault-tolerant
    5. Immutable
    6. Lazy evaluation
    7. Cache & persistence
    8. Inbuild-optimization when using DataFrames
    9. Supports ANSI SQL
